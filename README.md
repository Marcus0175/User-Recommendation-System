# User Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a **scalable recommendation system** that predicts product preferences for users based on their historical ratings. It demonstrates expertise in **data processing, feature engineering, and collaborative filtering techniques** suitable for large-scale datasets. The system is designed to handle noisy and sparse rating data efficiently, providing personalized recommendations for each user.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, normalized, and transformed raw user-product rating data into structured formats suitable for modeling.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implemented user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to capture user preferences and product similarities.
- **Scalability:** Optimized for processing large datasets with efficient data structures and algorithms.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance assessed using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to ensure accurate recommendations.
- **Extensible Pipeline:** Modular design allowing future integration with real-time data streams or hybrid recommendation approaches.
